      "content": "Mars landing\nA Mars landing is a landing of a spacecraft on the surface of Mars. Of multiple attempted Mars landings by robotic, uncrewed spacecraft, eleven have had successful soft landings. There have also been studies for a possible human mission to Mars including a landing, but none has been attempted.\nAs of 2025, the Soviet Union, United States, China, and European Space Agency (via the UK-led Beagle 2) have conducted Mars landings successfully.[1][2] Soviet Mars 3, which landed in 1971, was the first successful Mars landing, though the spacecraft failed after approximately 15 seconds of transmission on the surface.[3] All other Soviet Mars landing attempts failed.[3] Viking 1 and Viking 2 were the first successful NASA landers, launched in 1975. NASA's Mars Pathfinder, launched in 1996, successfully delivered the first Mars rover, Sojourner. In 2021, the first Chinese lander and rover, Tianwen 1,[4] successfully landed on Mars. The British Beagle 2 landed in 2003, but due to loss of contact and mission failure, its landing was only confirmed in 2015.[2]\nMethods of Descent and Landing\nAs of 2021, all methods of landing on Mars have used an aeroshell and parachute sequence for Mars atmospheric entry and descent, but after the parachute is detached, there are three options. A stationary lander can drop from the parachute back shell and ride retrorockets all the way down, but a rover cannot be burdened with rockets that serve no purpose after touchdown.\nOne method for lighter rovers is to enclose the rover in a tetrahedral structure which in turn is enclosed in airbags. After the aeroshell drops off, the tetrahedron is lowered clear of the parachute back shell on a tether so that the airbags can inflate. Retrorockets on the back shell can slow descent. When it nears the ground, the tetrahedron is released to drop to the ground, using the airbags as shock absorbers. When it has come to rest, the tetrahedron opens to expose the rover.[5]\nIf a rover is too heavy to use airbags, the retrorockets can be mounted on a sky crane. The sky crane drops from the parachute back shell and, as it nears the ground, the rover is lowered on a tether. When the rover touches ground, it cuts the tether so that the sky crane (with its rockets still firing) will crash well away from the rover. Both Curiosity and Perseverance used sky crane for landing.[6]\nDescent of heavier payloads\nThe thrusters of the InSight lander dug pits during landing beneath it at its landing site.\nFor landers that are even heavier than the Curiosity rover (which required a 4.5 meter (15 feet) diameter aeroshell), engineers tested a combination rigid-inflatable Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator in the 2010s that reached 8 meters (26 feet) in diameter. It was designed to be accompanied by a proportionately larger parachute.[7] As of 2025, the technology has not been used in operational Mars missions, with ongoing research exploring alternative entry, descent, and landing systems for heavier payloads, such as those needed for human exploration.\nLanding challenges\nLanding robotic spacecraft, and possibly some day humans, on Mars is a technological challenge. For a favorable landing, the lander module has to address these issues:[8][9]\nThinness of Mars's atmosphere\nMeasurement of distance to surface\nInadequate technology for ballistic aerocapture\nInadequate technology for retropropulsive powered descent\nInadequate mission designs\nShorter time to perform entry, descent and landing (EDL)\nIn 2018, NASA successfully landed the InSight lander on the surface of Mars, re-using Viking-era technology.[10] But this technology cannot afford the ability to land large number of cargoes, habitats, ascent vehicles and humans in case of crewed Mars missions in near future. Recent missions like Perseverance (2021) have demonstrated up to 1 tonne landed mass using sky crane and guided entry, paving the way for future supersonic retropropulsion for heavier payloads.[11] In order to improve and accomplish this intent, there is need to upgrade technologies and launch vehicles. Some of the criteria for a lander performing a successful soft-landing based on heritage designs up to the early 2010s are as follows, though recent missions have exceeded several limits:[12][8]\nFeature\tCriterion\nMass\tUp to approximately 1 tonne (2,200 lb), as demonstrated by Perseverance (2021)\nBallistic coefficient\tTypically 60–120 kg/m² for successful missions\nDiameter of aeroshell\tUp to 4.5 m (15 ft), as in MSL and Perseverance\nGeometry of aeroshell\t70° spherical cone shell\nDiameter of parachute\tUp to 21.5 m (70 ft), as in Perseverance\nDescent\tSubsonic retropropulsive powered descent (e.g., sky crane)\nEntry\tDirect hyperbolic entry (from interplanetary trajectory)\nCommunicating with Earth\nSince the first successful soft landing by the Soviet Mars 3 mission in 1971, all landers on the surface of Mars that have communicated with Earth have used orbiting spacecraft as communications satellites for relaying their data to Earth.[13] The landers use UHF transmitters to send their data to the orbiters, which then relay the data to Earth using either X band or Ka band frequencies. These higher frequencies, along with more powerful transmitters and larger parabolic reflectors, permit the orbiters to send the data much faster than the landers could manage transmitting directly to Earth, which conserves valuable time on the receiving antennas.[14]\nList of Mars landings\nIn the 1970s, several USSR probes unsuccessfully tried to land on Mars. Mars 3 landed successfully in 1971 but failed soon afterwards. But the American Viking landers made it to the surface and provided several years of images and data. However, the next successful Mars landing was not until 1997, when Mars Pathfinder landed.[15] In the 21st century there have been several successful landings, but there have also been many crashes.[15]\nMars probe program\nThe first probe intended to be a Mars impact lander was the Soviet Mars 1962B , unsuccessfully launched in 1962.[16]\nIn 1970 the Soviet Union began the design of Mars 4NM and Mars 5NM missions with super-heavy uncrewed Martian spacecraft. First was Marsokhod , with a planned date of early 1973, and second was the Mars sample return mission planned for 1975. Both spacecraft were intended to be launched on the N1 rocket, but this rocket never flew successfully and the Mars 4NM and Mars 5NM projects were cancelled.[17]\nIn 1971 the Soviet Union sent probes Mars 2 and Mars 3 , each carrying a lander, as part of the Mars probe program M-71. The Mars 2 lander failed to land and impacted Mars. The Mars 3 lander became the first probe to successfully soft-land on Mars, but its data-gathering had less success. The lander began transmitting to the Mars 3 orbiter 90 seconds after landing, but after 14.5 seconds, transmission ceased for unknown reasons. The cause of the failure may have been related to the extremely powerful Martian dust storm taking place at the time. These space probes each contained a Mars rover, PrOP-M, although they were never deployed.\nIn 1973, the Soviet Union sent two more landers to Mars, Mars 6 and Mars 7. The Mars 6 lander transmitted data during descent but failed upon impact. The Mars 7 probe separated prematurely from the carrying vehicle due to a problem in the operation of one of the onboard systems (attitude control or retro-rockets) and missed the planet by 1,300 km (810 mi).\nThe double-launching Mars 5M (Mars-79) sample return mission was planned for 1979, but was cancelled due to complexity and technical problems.\nViking program\nIn 1976 two American Viking probes entered orbit about Mars and each released a lander module that made a successful soft landing on the planet's surface. They subsequently had the first successful transmission of large volumes of data, including the first color pictures and extensive scientific information. Measured temperatures at the landing sites ranged from 150 to 250 K (−123 to −23 °C; −190 to −10 °F), with a variation over a given day of 35 to 50 °C (95 to 122 °F). Seasonal dust storms, pressure changes, and movement of atmospheric gases between the polar caps were observed. A biology experiment produced possible evidence of life, but it was not corroborated by other on-board experiments.\nWhile searching for a suitable landing spot for Viking 2 's lander, the Viking 1 orbiter photographed the landform that constitutes the so-called \"Face on Mars\" on 25 July 1976.\nThe Viking program was a descendant of the cancelled Voyager program, whose name was later reused for a pair of outer solar system probes.\nMars Pathfinder\nNASA's Mars Pathfinder spacecraft, with assistance from the Mars Global Surveyor orbiter, landed on 4 July 1997. Its landing site was an ancient flood plain in Mars's northern hemisphere called Ares Vallis, which is among the rockiest parts of Mars. It carried a tiny remote-controlled rover called Sojourner, the first successful Mars rover, that traveled a few meters around the landing site, exploring the conditions and sampling rocks around it. Newspapers around the world carried images of the lander dispatching the rover to explore the surface of Mars in a way never achieved before.\nUntil the final data transmission on 27 September 1997, Mars Pathfinder returned 16,500 images from the lander and 550 images from the rover, as well as more than 15 chemical analyses of rocks and soil and extensive data on winds and other weather factors. Findings from the investigations carried out by scientific instruments on both the lander and the rover suggest that in the past Mars has been warm and wet, with liquid water and a thicker atmosphere. The mission website was the most heavily trafficked up to that time.\nSpate of failures\nMars Spacecraft 1988–1999\tEvaluation\tHad or was Lander\nPhobos 1\tNo\tFor Phobos\nPhobos 2\tYes\tFor Phobos\nMars Observer\tNo\tNo\nMars 96\tNo\tYes\nMars Pathfinder\tYes\tYes\nMars Global Surveyor\tYes\tNo\nMars Climate Orbiter\tNo\tNo\nMars Polar Lander\tNo\tYes\nDeep Space 2\tNo\tYes\nNozomi\tNo\tNo\nMars 96 , an orbiter launched on 16 November 1996 by Russia, failed when the planned second burn of the Block D-2 fourth stage did not occur. Following the success of Global Surveyor and Pathfinder, another spate of failures occurred in 1998 and 1999, with the Japanese Nozomi orbiter and NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter , Mars Polar Lander , and Deep Space 2 penetrators all suffering various terminal errors. Mars Climate Orbiter is infamous for Lockheed Martin engineers mixing up the usage of U.S. customary units with metric units, causing the orbiter to burn up while entering Mars's atmosphere. Out of 5–6 NASA missions in the 1990s, only 2 worked: Mars Pathfinder and Mars Global Surveyor, making Mars Pathfinder and its rover the only successful Mars landing in the 1990s.\nMars Express and Beagle 2\nOn 2 June 2003, the European Space Agency's Mars Express set off from Baikonur Cosmodrome to Mars. The Mars Express craft consisted of the Mars Express Orbiter and the lander Beagle 2. Although the landing probe was not designed to move, it carried a digging device and the least massive spectrometer created to date, as well as a range of other devices, on a robotic arm in order to accurately analyse soil beneath the dusty surface.\nThe orbiter entered Mars orbit on 25 December 2003, and Beagle 2 should have entered Mars's atmosphere the same day. However, attempts to contact the lander failed. Communications attempts continued throughout January, but Beagle 2 was declared lost in mid-February, and a joint inquiry was launched by the UK and ESA that blamed principal investigator Colin Pillinger's poor project management. Nevertheless, Mars Express Orbiter confirmed the presence of water ice and carbon dioxide ice at the planet's south pole. NASA had previously confirmed their presence at the north pole of Mars.\nSigns of the Beagle 2 lander were found in 2013 by the HiRISE camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , and the Beagle 2 's presence was confirmed in January 2015, several months after Pillinger's death. The lander appears to have successfully landed but not deployed all of its power and communications panels.\nMars Exploration Rovers\nShortly after the launch of Mars Express, NASA sent a pair of twin rovers toward the planet as part of the Mars Exploration Rover mission. On 10 June 2003, NASA's MER-A (Spirit) Mars Exploration Rover was launched. It successfully landed in Gusev Crater (believed once to have been a crater lake) on 3 January 2004. It examined rock and soil for evidence of the area's history of water. On 7 July 2003, a second rover, MER-B (Opportunity) was launched. It landed on 24 January 2004 in Meridiani Planum (where there are large deposits of hematite, indicating the presence of past water) to carry out similar geological work.\nDespite a temporary loss of communication with the Spirit rover (caused by a file system anomaly[18]) delaying exploration for several days, both rovers eventually began exploring their landing sites. The rover Opportunity landed in a particularly interesting spot, a crater with bedrock outcroppings. In fast succession, mission team members announced on 2 March that data returned from the rover showed that these rocks were once \"drenched in water\", and on 23 March that it was concluded that they were laid down underwater in a salty sea. This represented the first strong direct evidence for liquid water on Mars at some time in the past.\nTowards the end of July 2005, it was reported by the Sunday Times that the rovers may have carried the bacteria Bacillus safensis to Mars. According to one NASA microbiologist, this bacteria could survive both the trip and conditions on Mars. Despite efforts to sterilise both landers, neither could be assured to be completely sterile.[19]\nHaving been designed for only three-month missions, both rovers lasted much longer than planned. Spirit lost contact with Earth in March 2010, 74 months after commencing exploration. Opportunity , however, continued to carry out surveys of the planet, surpassing 45 km (28 mi) on its odometer by the time communication with it was lost in June 2018, 173 months after it began.[20][21] These rovers have discovered many new things, including Heat Shield Rock, the first meteorite to be discovered on another planet.\nHere is some debris from a Mars landing, as viewed by a Rover. This shows the area around a heat shield and resulting shield impact crater. The heat shield was jettisoned during the descent, impacting the surface on its own trajectory, while the spacecraft went on to land the rover.\nPhoenix\nPhoenix launched on 4 August 2007, and touched down on the northern polar region of Mars on 25 May 2008. It is famous for having been successfully photographed while landing, since this was the first time one spacecraft captured the landing of another spacecraft onto a planet.[22]\nMars Science Laboratory\nThe Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) (and Curiosity rover), launched in November 2011, landed in a location that is now called \"Bradbury Landing\", on Aeolis Palus, between Peace Vallis and Aeolis Mons (\"Mount Sharp\"), in Gale Crater on Mars on 6 August 2012, 05:17 UTC.[23][24] The landing site was in Quad 51 (\"Yellowknife\")[25][26][27][28] of Aeolis Palus near the base of Aeolis Mons. The landing site[29] was less than 2.4 km (1.5 mi) from the center of the rover's planned target site after a 563,000,000 km (350,000,000 mi) journey.[30] NASA named the landing site \"Bradbury Landing\", in honor of author Ray Bradbury, on 22 August 2012.[29]\nExoMars Schiaparelli\nThe Schiaparelli lander was intended to test technology for future soft landings on the surface of Mars as part of the ExoMars project. It was built in Italy by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Roscosmos. It was launched together with the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) on 14 March 2016 and attempted a landing on 19 October 2016. Telemetry was lost about one minute before the scheduled landing time,[31] but confirmed that most elements of the landing plan, including heat shield operation, parachute deployment, and rocket activation, had been successful.[32] The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter later captured imagery showing what appears to be Schiaparelli's crash site.[33]\nInSight\nNASA's InSight lander , designed to study seismology and heat flow from the deep interior of Mars, was launched on 5 May 2018. It landed successfully in Mars's Elysium Planitia on 26 November 2018.[34]\nMars 2020 and Tianwen-1\nNASA's Mars 2020 and CNSA's Tianwen-1 were both launched in the July 2020 window. Mars 2020's rover Perseverance successfully landed, in a location that is now called \"Octavia E. Butler Landing\", in Jezero Crater on 18 February 2021,[35] Ingenuity helicopter was deployed and took subsequent flights in April.[36] Tianwen -1's lander and Zhurong rover landed in Utopia Planitia on 14 May 2021 with the rover being deployed on 22 May 2021 and dropping a remote selfie camera on 1 June 2021.[37]\nFuture missions\nThe ESA's Rosalind Franklin rover is planned for launch in 2028 with a new European lander developed by Airbus and would obtain soil samples from up to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) depth and make an extensive search for biosignatures and biomolecules. There is an ongoing Mars Sample Return Mission by ESA and NASA, with sample return projected for 2035–2039 following redesigns announced in 2025.[38] This mission would be part of the European Aurora Programme.\nThe Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)'s Mangalyaan-2 mission, approved in 2025, plans to land a rover and rotorcraft/helicopter around 2031.[39] China plans the Tianwen-3 sample-return mission for launch around 2028, including a landing and ascent vehicle.[40]\nLanding site identification\nLanding site identification for Mars missions involves two primary phases: pre-mission selection based on orbital data and real-time hazard detection and avoidance during entry, descent, and landing (EDL). These processes ensure safe touchdowns in challenging terrain while prioritizing scientific objectives.[41]\nPre-mission site selection begins years before launch, using high-resolution imagery and topographic data from orbiters such as NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). Candidate sites are evaluated for engineering constraints, including low elevation (to allow thicker atmosphere for aerobraking), latitudes between 5°N and 5°S for sufficient solar power, slopes less than 15 degrees, and few rocks larger than 0.5 meters to avoid damaging the lander or rover. Sites are also chosen for scientific value, such as evidence of past water or habitability. For example, the Perseverance rover's Jezero Crater site was selected in 2017 after workshops evaluating multiple candidates.[42][43]\nDuring descent, advanced missions employ autonomous systems to identify and avoid hazards in real time. Early landers like Viking relied on pre-selected \"go/no-go\" zones without onboard imaging. However, since the 2010s, technologies like the Hazard Detection and Avoidance (HDA) system have been developed. NASA's Perseverance mission (landed February 2021) used Terrain-Relative Navigation (TRN), which compares descent images from onboard cameras to onboard maps derived from MRO data, enabling precise landing within 100 meters of the target and avoiding slopes or boulders. China's Tianwen-1 mission (landed May 2021) also incorporated similar autonomous capabilities for its Zhurong rover in Utopia Planitia. As of October 2025, no additional soft landings have occurred, but future missions like NASA's Mars Sample Return plan to leverage enhanced precision landing technologies.[44][45]\nTwinned locations to Mars Landing sites on Earth\nIn the run-up to NASA’s Mars 2020 landing, former planetary scientist and film-maker Christopher Riley mapped the locations of all eight of NASA's successful Mars landing sites onto their equivalent spots on Earth, in terms of latitudes and longitudes; presenting pairs of photographs from each twinned interplanetary location on Earth and Mars to draw attention to climate change.[46] Following the successful landing of NASA's Perseverance Rover on February 18, 2021, Riley called for volunteers to travel to and photograph its twinned Earth location in Andegaon Wadi, Sawali, in the central Indian state of Maharashtra (18.445°N, 77.451°E).[47][48][49] Eventually BBC World Service radio programme Digital Planet listener Gowri Abhiram, from Hyderabad took up the challenge, and travelled there on the 22nd January 2022, becoming the first person to knowingly reach a spot on Earth that matches the latitude and longitude of a robotic presence on the surface of another world.[50] China's Tianwen-1 landing site maps onto an area in Southern China, 40 kilometres Southwest of Guilin and is yet to be photographed for the project.[48]",
